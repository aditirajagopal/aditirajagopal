					I plan to make an impact through a professional, personal, and advocacy lens. 
					Professionally, I want to build and grow resilient and empowered product teams that embody a "stakeholder 
					first" mentality. Given my skills at the intersection of business, technology, and data science, I want to 
					challenge my teams to creatively solve problems using data while acting responsibly and ethically. Based on 
					my past experiences working in turbulent organizations, I firmly believe that facilitating environments where 
					psychological safety and inclusion are at the forefront enable individuals to bring their best selves to any 
					challenge. I want to raise these expectations and redefine the possibilities for positive work environments 
					across the tech industry. I aspire to be a lifelong learner and to pick up skills no matter how mundane or 
					eccentric - for example, learning how to make homemade pizza dough and pepcorn and sharing this passion with 
					others has encouraged team bonding for various projects. From an advocacy perspective, I plan to channel my 
					skills into my local community by engaging with public policy leaders in my area and continuing my leadership 
					with the Society of Women Engineers and other advocacy programs. Bringing these aspirations together, I want to 
					take my learnings from the KPCB Fellowship to facilitate the growth of the Midwest's tech sector by growing and 
					investing in ventures in the region while seeking opportunities for public and private sector partnerships to 
					promote economic development. I want to help rebuild and strengthen the community that raised me.

					When I joined IBM's Rochester Minnesota office, someone who took an early interest in me was Jim, a senior 
					engineer and IBM "Master Inventor." Jim quickly turned into my mentor, innovation coach, and "work BFF" - 
					he helped me foment the direction of my life by always asking the question, "what's the goal?" Jim saw my 
					interest in the intersection of technology, design, and business as an asset, whereas in the past, many 
					misinterpreted these passions as a lack of interest in core engineering and technology. Jim nurtured my 
					potential and pushed me to channel my curiosity into action via patents and side projects. Working with Jim 
					eepened my appreciation for the tech industry and fueled me to encourage others to embrace engineering and 
					technology as a career path.  Through volunteerism, I aspired to make tech accessible to others in ways 
					that it wasn't for me (via the Society of Women Engineers, Girls Who Code, etc.) and mentoring (Darden MBA 
					mentoring programs, Women's Association of Venture and Equity, etc.). This past year has been especially 
					tumultuous for my family and me, but reflecting on Jim's mantra, "what's the goal," and on how he lived his 
					life has helped me zone in on what matters most to me, and what it means to live a well-rounded life. I want to 
					honor his memory by applying my learnings, leadership, and interpersonal skills to solve impossible problems 
					and to support those who matter the most to me.
